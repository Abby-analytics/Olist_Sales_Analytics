## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Optimize Logistics:**  
   Improve delivery efficiency for distant states (RR, AP, AM) to reduce average delivery days and late deliveries.  

2. **Diversify Market Reach:**  
   Expand targeted campaigns in low-performing regions to reduce dependence on SP and RJ.  

3. **Reassess Freight Model:**  
   Align freight pricing with delivery performance and explore partnerships with faster logistics providers.  

4. **Broaden Product Focus:**  
   Promote well-rated but low-revenue categories (Books, Flowers) through discounts or visibility campaigns.  

5. **Encourage Payment Variety:**  
   Offer small incentives (e.g., cashback or discounts) for using alternative payment methods such as Boleto or Debit Card.

## 🧭 Conclusion

The Olist Store dashboards reveal a **strongly growing e-commerce platform** with solid sales and customer satisfaction.  
However, key opportunities lie in:
